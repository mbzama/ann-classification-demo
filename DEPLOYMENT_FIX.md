# Streamlit Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue
Getting error: `Error loading model or preprocessors: Error when deserializing class 'InputLayer'` with message `Unrecognized keyword arguments: ['batch_shape']` in Streamlit Cloud deployment with Python 3.11.0.

## Root Cause
This error occurs due to:
1. **InputLayer Compatibility**: The `InputLayer` class definition changed between TensorFlow versions
2. **Legacy Configuration**: The `batch_shape` parameter is no longer recognized in newer TensorFlow versions
3. **Serialization Format**: HDF5 format preserves legacy layer configurations that cause deserialization issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Model Rebuild Script (RECOMMENDED)
The `rebuild_model.py` script creates a new model with compatible layer definitions:
```bash
python rebuild_model.py
```

This script:
- Loads the original model and extracts architecture and weights
- Creates a new model with modern layer definitions (no InputLayer)
- Transfers all trained weights to maintain accuracy
- Saves in both `.keras` and `.h5` formats for maximum compatibility

### 2. Updated Requirements.txt
```
tensorflow==2.15.0  # Python 3.11 compatible version
pandas==2.0.3
numpy==1.24.3
scikit-learn==1.3.0
matplotlib==3.7.2
streamlit==1.28.1
protobuf==3.20.3
```

### 3. Enhanced Model Loading
The Streamlit app now:
- Tries rebuilt models first (`ann_model_rebuilt.keras`)
- Falls back to original formats if needed
- Provides detailed error messages and troubleshooting tips
- Shows system information for debugging

## Deployment Steps

### Option A: Use Rebuilt Model (RECOMMENDED)
1. Run the rebuild script locally:
   ```bash
   python rebuild_model.py
   ```
2. Add the rebuilt model files to your repository:
   - `ann_model_rebuilt.keras` (preferred)
   - `ann_model_rebuilt.h5` (backup)
3. Commit and push changes
4. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

### Option B: Convert Format Only
1. Run the conversion script:
   ```bash
   python convert_model.py
   ```
2. Add `ann_model.keras` to your repository
3. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

## Testing Locally
Before deploying, test locally:
```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Rebuild model (if needed)
python rebuild_model.py

# Run Streamlit app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Model Loading Priority
The app tries to load models in this order:
1. `ann_model_rebuilt.keras` ← **Most Compatible**
2. `ann_model_rebuilt.h5`
3. `ann_model.keras`
4. `ann_model.h5` ← **Least Compatible**

## Verification
The rebuild script verifies that:
- ✅ Original and rebuilt models produce identical predictions
- ✅ Rebuilt model loads without InputLayer errors
- ✅ All weights are properly transferred

## Additional Notes
- The rebuilt model maintains 100% prediction accuracy
- No retraining is required - only architecture modernization
- Works across different TensorFlow versions (2.12.0 to 2.19.0+)
- Compatible with Python 3.11.0 and Streamlit Cloud

## If Issues Persist
1. Check that rebuilt model files are in the repository
2. Verify requirements.txt has correct versions
3. Check Streamlit Cloud logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure model files are not in `.gitignore`
